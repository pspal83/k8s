Docker networking / Container Networking ;

1) each container  should have the   unique ipaddress.  (True)

2) two container should be communicate to each other .  (True)

3) container should be go out side the docker machine .  (True)



Note:

1) Container  network by default works on Bridge Network concept.

2) Bridge: it is software define network which works l2 switch for container .

3) During the installation Bridge plugin already has  installed .

4) docker system already has create one bridge network after installation with 172.17.0.0/16 subnet range


5)  external users want to reach your container .

Note: By deafult container IP address is kind of private IP which can access only from docker machine.

	1. Configure Route tables: Which is not recomeded 
	2. Port Forwarding: 
	# docker run -d --name=web -p 8080:80 nginx
	# docker run -d --name=web -p 192.168.44.40:8081:80 nginx
	# docker run -d --name=web -p 192.168.44.40:8082:80 -p 8083:81 -p 8084:82 nginx

Port Forwarding have 2 types:

	1. Static Port forwarding: -p hostport:containerport.
	2. Dynamic Port forwaring: -P no need to give any port number, it autmaticaly took any rendom port.

Bridge Network:

	1. All they have IP address.
	2. All they can communicate to each other.
	3. They can go outside the docker host via docker base machine IP address.
	4. Via Port forwarding can access external client.

Host Networking:
	
	1. It directly connect with you base machine interfaces.
	2. It have IP address which is running dcoker machine interface.
	3. container can directly reach by host machine IP adrress.
	4. but same container can't run at a time. but old container also took the ports. 
	5. This network you can use for SRI-OV base containers. 

None Networking:

	1. If you want to test you container without network use NONE networking.
	2. 

6) I want to intregrate balancer across the container.
	
	1. You can use HAPROXY as a software loadbalancer.
	2. AWS loadbalancer --> Application loadbalancer --> use internet, zone map, security group, create target group (and add you VM 
give name in target and create, select port numbers, use include option. create target group and check on LB tab --> provide target group and create LB.

7) DNS system

	1. container can connect via name, if any container get reboot(IP will be changed), other conatiner can connect with same conatiner with name only. because after reboot container IP always changed.

	2. Example: create one network with bridge.
	3. Example: create 2 conatiner one for mysql 2 for wordpress app and check.
